# Roman Numeral Converter
## Description
This project utilises JS, HTML and CSS that takes a number input from the user that is typed into the input box which is converted to the equivalent in Roman numeral format.
The input only allows numbers within 1 - 3999 to be passed. Any none numerical inputs provide an error. 1-3999 is the unfortunate limitation that could be improved upon in the future.
Some challenges I faced during this project were making the error box appear upon creating an error rather than a permanent box/segment on the page. Another was creating the needed error messages for the likely unique errors i.e., invalid input, integer is less than 1, integer is greater than 3999.

This project was done as part of learning JS in freeCodeCamp.
